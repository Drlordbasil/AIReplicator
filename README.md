3. **Support and Maintenance:** Providing dedicated support and maintenance services to users, including bug fixes, updates, and troubleshooting, can generate a steady stream of income.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- `copy` module (already built-in)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-complexity-evolution.git
    ```
2. Change into the project directory:
    ```
    cd ai-complexity-evolution
    ```

### Usage
1. Import the necessary classes:
    ```
    from ai_complexity_evolution import AI, NeuralNetwork, MachineLearningAlgorithm, ...
    ```
2. Create instances of AI objects, neural networks, algorithms, decision trees, data processors, language processors, image processors, speech recognitions, robotics, etc.
3. Interact with the AI and its components by calling various methods or printing relevant information.

## Example

Here is an example of how to use the different components provided by the project:

```python
# Create AI objects
ai1 = AI("AI 1", complexity_level=1)
ai2 = ai1.replicate("AI 2")
ai2.increase_complexity()

# Create NeuralNetwork object
neural_network = NeuralNetwork()
neural_network.add_layer("Input Layer")
neural_network.add_layer("Hidden Layer")
neural_network.add_layer("Output Layer")

# Create MachineLearningAlgorithm object
ml_algorithm = MachineLearningAlgorithm("K-means")
ml_algorithm.train()

# Create GeneticAlgorithm object
genetic_algorithm = GeneticAlgorithm("Genetic Algorithm")
genetic_algorithm.evolve()

# Create ReinforcementLearning object
reinforcement_learning = ReinforcementLearning("Q-learning")
reinforcement_learning.learn()

# Create DecisionTree object
decision_tree = DecisionTree()
decision_tree.add_node("Root Node")
decision_tree.add_node("Child Node 1")
decision_tree.add_node("Child Node 2")
decision_tree.add_node("Child Node 3")

# ... and so on for other components

# Print output
print(ai1.name)  # Output: "AI 1"
print(ai2.name)  # Output: "AI 2"
print(ai2.complexity_level)  # Output: 2

neural_network.print_network()
# Output:
# Input Layer
# Hidden Layer
# Output Layer

print(ml_algorithm.name)  # Output: "K-means"

# ... print the information of other components ...

```
